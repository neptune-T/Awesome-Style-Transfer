The revolutionary advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has fundamentally transformed the landscape of visual content creation and artistic expression. Despite the remarkable achievements in image generation and style transfer, the underlying mechanisms and aesthetic implications of these technologies remain to be systematically explored. This paper presents a comprehensive review of AIGC in visual arts, examining its evolution from traditional algorithmic approaches to contemporary deep learning frameworks. We first distill the core components of modern AIGC systems, focusing on three pivotal technological paradigms: Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Diffusion Models. Building upon this foundation, we analyze how these technologies bridge the gap between human creativity and machine generation, particularly in the context of style transfer and image synthesis. To evaluate the performance and impact of AIGC systems, we propose a systematic framework encompassing multiple perspectives: Technical Innovation, Artistic Merit, Visual Quality, Computational Efficiency, and Creative Potential. Our analysis reveals both the transformative capabilities and current limitations of AIGC technologies, while highlighting their profound implications for the future of visual arts and creative practices. Through extensive examination of recent developments and emerging trends, we provide insights into the convergence of artificial intelligence and artistic expression, suggesting promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.

\section{Introduction}

\textsl{"The slumbering pigments awaken on the canvas, much like a garden kissed by the dawn’s first light."} This scene reflects the countless mornings witnessed by Monet in his garden at Giverny. Today, on the canvas of the digital world, artificial intelligence is conjuring the magic of creation anew. From the symphony of light and water discovered by Impressionist masters in the gentle Paris rain to the passionate strokes with which Van Gogh articulated his fervor beneath the starry skies of Provence, the history of art unfolds as a poem of breakthroughs and innovation. At this moment, standing at the threshold of the age of artificial intelligence, we bear witness to another magnificent variation of visual art. 

In this visual feast, each pixel serves as a dynamic note, while every line of code resonates like a poet’s whisper. Just as Leonardo da Vinci captured the eternal smile in the "Mona Lisa," AIGC technology—this digital sorcerer—employs sophisticated algorithms to seize each fleeting moment of human creativity. When words are transmuted into images, they symbolize the blossoming of thoughts within the digital garden; when artistic styles flow between images, it engenders a dialogue that transcends temporal and spatial boundaries.

Within the vast domain of computer vision and multimedia processing, the exploration of AIGC has transcended mere technological innovation, delving into the fundamental essence of human creativity. It illustrates that, in the digital realm, creativity can surpass physical constraints, and imagination can manifest as tangible reality. Each image generated by AI stands as a testament to the harmonious fusion of technology and art, epitomizing a synthesis of rationality and emotion.

This survey primarily focuses on advancements in image style transfer technologies, investigating the latest developments in artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) as they relate to style transfer and diffusion style transfer. Our work delves into various aspects of these technologies, including methodological innovations, performance assessments, architectural designs, and optimization criteria that enhance their effectiveness. Additionally, we outline prospective research directions, signifying not only a technological breakthrough but also a pivotal chapter in the ongoing narrative of artistic evolution. In an age where technology enhances artistic expression, a transformative visual revolution is progressively emerging.

\subsection{History and Scope}

In Van Gogh's "Starry Night," swirling brushstrokes bring the night sky to life; in Monet's "Water Lilies," vibrant colors animate the water's surface. Today, artificial intelligence inherits these great artists' explorations of the visual world in a novel manner. In the digital age, AIGC technology is writing a new chapter that intertwines technology and art.

Tracing the roots of this visual revolution, pioneers in computer graphics began exploring the possibilities of digital image generation as early as the 1960s. In 1964, Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad system first demonstrated the potential of computer-assisted image creation\cite{sutherland1964sketch}.Since then, the field of computer vision has undergone continuous breakthroughs, evolving from rule-based image processing to texture synthesis. The introduction of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) by Kingma and Welling in 2013 marked the dawn of a new era in deep learning generative models \cite{kingma2013auto}. This innovation inspired an array of advancements, leading to more specialized and robust architectures that extended the capabilities of VAEs in areas such as disentangled representation learning and conditional generation\cite{sohn2015learning} \cite{higgins2017beta}\cite{van2017neural}\cite{burda2015importance}\cite{kim2018disentangling}\cite{rezende2016variationalinferencenormalizingflows}\cite{Shalchi_2016}\cite{van2017neural}\cite{gulrajani2016pixelvae}\cite{sonderby2016ladder}.In 2014, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) proposed by Goodfellow et al. provided a powerful new framework for image generation, enabling machines to understand and create complex visual content \cite{goodfellow2014generative}. Following this milestone, GANs rapidly evolved, with successive models pushing the boundaries of image fidelity, stability, and control in generative tasks\cite{mirza2014conditional}\cite{radford2015unsupervised}\cite{arjovsky2017wasserstein}\cite{gulrajani2017improved}\cite{mao2017least}\cite{karras2017progressive}\cite{karras2019style}\cite{brock2018large}, thus broadening their applicability across various domains of computer vision.

In the realm of style transfer, the neural style transfer algorithm published by Gatys et al. in 2015 realized the dream of transferring an artist's unique style to any image\cite{gatys2015neural}. This breakthrough quickly spurred a wave of innovations, ranging from real-time style transfer to arbitrary style transfer, as the technology evolved and numerous fusion innovations emerged\cite{johnson2016perceptual}\cite{ulyanov2016texture}\cite{huang2017arbitrary}\cite{li2017universal}\cite{zhu2017unpaired}\cite{choi2018stargan}\cite{karras2019style}\cite{radford2021learning}.In 2020, the diffusion models introduced by Ho et al. elevated image generation to new heights, continuously presenting new ideas and results\cite{ho2020denoising}. The advent of models such as Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney has turned the once-elusive dream of "text-to-image generation" into reality\cite{song2020score}\cite{nichol2021improved}\cite{dhariwal2021diffusion}\cite{rombach2022high}\cite{saharia2022photorealistic}\cite{ramesh2021zero}, heralding the arrival of a new era in AIGC.


\subsection{Related Previous Surveys}

Several surveys have reviewed the application of deep learning techniques in style transfer, particularly focusing on generative models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and more recently, diffusion models. These surveys have provided valuable insights into the evolution of style transfer, discussing both traditional and modern approaches to the task.

Early surveys primarily emphasized the optimization of loss functions in traditional neural network-based style transfer methods. These methods focused on transferring style from a reference image to a content image, while struggling to maintain a balance between content preservation and style injection. Issues related to computational efficiency and training instability were also prominent. With the advent of GAN-based methods, challenges such as mode collapse and difficulties in achieving fine-grained control over style features further complicated the process.

In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as a promising alternative, with several reviews beginning to explore their potential in generative tasks, including image generation and denoising. Diffusion models stand out for their ability to iteratively refine the image generation process, offering advantages in terms of sample quality and training stability compared to traditional methods like GANs. However, many of these surveys have focused on diffusion models' applications in image generation rather than in style transfer. The exploration of diffusion models in style transfer is still in its early stages, with limited focus on the unique challenges involved in integrating style features into the generative process.

Additionally, the integration of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) with style transfer techniques, particularly in text-guided style transfer, has gained attention. CLIP’s capacity to align visual and textual representations has been widely discussed, yet the challenges associated with the flexibility and ambiguity of user-defined prompts—leading to inconsistencies in style transfer—are not thoroughly addressed in the existing surveys.

Although some reviews have begun to examine the potential of diffusion models for style transfer, there remains a gap in understanding the mechanisms through which these models can effectively integrate style features. Furthermore, the role of CLIP in guiding style transfer through diffusion models is still underexplored, and challenges regarding the precision and consistency of style transfer persist.

This survey aims to fill these gaps by providing a comprehensive synthesis of the latest advancements in text-guided style transfer using diffusion models. We emphasize the need for improvements in efficiency, stability, and precision, and explore the emerging trends and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.
