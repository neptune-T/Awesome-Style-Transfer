\section{Basic Concepts of Style Transfer}

\subsection{Historical Background of Style Transfer}
In the early stages of Neural Style Transfer (NST), the field was primarily focused on non-neural techniques for artistic rendering, where the goal was to simulate specific artistic styles using traditional image processing methods. This shift towards stylization was notably influenced by advancements in Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) in the mid-1990s, which aimed to emulate artistic effects like oil painting and watercolor. However, these methods were typically confined to specific styles and lacked the flexibility to adapt to a wider range of artistic expressions.

As research progressed, the focus gradually shifted towards statistical characteristics of image textures. Techniques like histogram matching and texture synthesis introduced statistical approaches to stylization, providing more generalizable methods for extracting and transferring textures between images. For instance, texture synthesis using Markov Random Fields (MRF) successfully matched the statistical properties of pixel neighborhoods to generate visually consistent textures. Although these methods excelled in preserving texture fidelity, they struggled to capture the global structural features of the style image.

A significant breakthrough in NST occurred in 2015, when Gatys et al. proposed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to disentangle the content and style of images, allowing the transfer of one image’s style to another\cite{gatys2015neural}. Through deep feature extraction, they introduced the Gram matrix to capture the correlations between style features. The Gram matrix models the statistical relationships between feature maps within the convolutional layers of the network, enabling the preservation of both texture and structural characteristics of the style image. This approach marked a pivotal turning point in the field, enabling a level of style diversity and fidelity that had previously been unattainable.This neural approach not only overcame the limitations of fixed, predefined styles but also allowed generated stylized images to maintain the semantic content of the original image while incorporating the artistic features of the style. As a result, NST gained widespread attention in both academic and industrial circles, sparking numerous algorithmic innovations and significantly expanding its practical applications.

For a comprehensive review of early developments and detailed discussions on the evolution of NST, the paper\cite{jing2018neural} provides an in-depth analysis, offering a thorough examination of the various milestones in style transfer research.


\subsection{Definitions of Style and Content}

In Neural Style Transfer (NST), clearly defining “style” and “content” is essential for achieving successful transformations, as these concepts form the basis for controlling the output image. \textbf{Content generally refers to the primary structure of an image, including object shapes, spatial arrangements, and overall composition. It describes the “what” of an image—such as the contours and layout of people, landscapes, or buildings—without focusing on specific visual aesthetics.} In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), content features can be extracted from deeper layers, as these deeper layers retain high-level semantic information, essential for identifying the main structure of an image.

In contrast, \textbf{style represents the artistic elements that impart unique visual characteristics to an image, such as color distributions, texture patterns, and artistic details. Style captures the “how” of an image, representing brushstrokes, color combinations, or distinctive textures of an artist’s technique.} As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:NST_example}
, NST combines these two distinct elements—content and style—from separate images to produce a single output that maintains the structure of the content image while adopting the artistic qualities of the style image.
